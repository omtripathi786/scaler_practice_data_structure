Problem Description
You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size QÃ—2.
Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] < N

Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers.
Second argument B is a 2D array of integers.
Output Format
Return an array of integers.

nput 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [   [0, 2]
        [2, 4]
        [1, 4]   ]
Input 2:
A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9, 6]
B = [   [0, 3]
        [3, 5]
        [1, 3]
        [2, 4]   ]


Example Output
Output 1:
[1, 1, 2]
Output 2:
[2, 1, 1, 1]
